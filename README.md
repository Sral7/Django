# S-Pass

S-Pass is a password mangement website built using Django, orginally built with wxPython modules. I decided to that a good way to practice html/css would be to make that project into a website and have the UI built using html and css.
With S-Pass a user can create an account to securely store their username/email/password for any site. The encryption process uses key dervation to derive an encryption key based on the users master password and their decryption pin. The derived key is then used to 
encrypt and decrypt the data added to S-Pass.
